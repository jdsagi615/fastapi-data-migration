# Overview of API Functionality and Features

This Local REST API is created in the context of data migration to accomplish:
1. Receive historical data from CSV files
2. Upload these files to a new DB
3. Be able to insert batch transactions (1 up to 1000 rows) with one request
4. Use queries to return: 
    4.1 Number of employees hired for each job and department in 2021 divided by quarter. The
table must be ordered alphabetically by department and job
    4.2   List of ids, name and number of employees hired of each department that hired more
employees than the mean of employees hired in 2021 for all the departments, ordered
by the number of employees hired
